            <h2>Why am I interested in this course?</h2>
            <p>Earlier this year I started teaching myself how to code as a hobby. I quickly realised that it was something I actually seemed to be good at and truly enjoyed. More and more I felt that it was something I could see myself doing for a living. All of my current skills are self-taught and hence surely lack some vital structure and best practice knowledge. I have been looking for a course for a while that could help me learn in a more organised and structured way. Entering a new field, especially a very male-dominated one, can be intimidating, and so when I found this Tech for Women course it seemed like the perfect opportunity to be able to learn and thrive in a group of women and non-binaries.<br> At the end of this course, should I be accepted, I hope to have a strong foundation to continue to build from and the confidence to go after the future career I have started to envision for myself.</p>
