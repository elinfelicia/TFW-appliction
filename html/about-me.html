                <h1>Elin Riihimäki</h1>
                <p>My name is Elin and I have recently moved back to Sweden after about a decade of living abroad.  While I was in my final year of the IB program in High School I was struggling somewhat with my mental health which resulted in me unfortunately not completing all of the courses required for my diploma. I have since studied abroad, both at a vocational school and at a language school, and worked full-time while not studying, and part-time through most of my studies.  Immediately after high school, I moved away from Sweden and got into the hospitality industry, which took me from the islands of Greece to Amsterdam, and Sydney, Australia. During my time in the hospitality industry, I held positions such as supervisor, head bartender, and for a short period also bar manager. Whilst in Australia I eventually decided to return to school. I studied at a vocational college where I received my Diploma of Leadership and Management. After finishing my studies in Australia I moved on to study the Japanese language in Tokyo for nearly 2 years. <br> While studying in Tokyo, I worked part-time for an education agency for foreign students. I was offered a full-time position at the end of my studies which I accepted and stayed with the company until October 2022, when I decided to stay in Sweden and attempt a career change. <br> I am driven by curiosity and a passion for learning. I thrive in collaborative environments, and always enjoy a good brainstorming session where we can solve a problem together. <br> Beyond programming, my main interests involve languages and etymology, as well as movies and entertainment, and ideally, I would like to include some of them in my future career. And that is one of the beauties of the tech industry, it exists in almost all other fields, and is not restricted to one particular type of business. In this digital age, developers are needed everywhere and programming and IT skills can be combined with almost any other interest. To me, being able to do exactly that, is an extremely exciting prospect. </p>
