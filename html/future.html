            <h2>Why would I be a good future developer?</h2>
            <p>My brain has always been geared towards logic, creativity and languages, which I believe are all important pillars that make up a good developer. I have a keen eye for detail and a knack for problem-solving. The idea of creating something new that will help people in various ways genuinely excites me.
                <br>Having moved all around the world on my own throughout my late teens and twenties, I believe I have gained a rather unique perspective on life and an ability to solve most challenges that come my way. I think a great team of developers is made up of people from different backgrounds and with different ways of thinking and looking at the problem - a variety of minds examining the task at hand from their own unique point of view, and all coming together to find the best solution. I believe that I can contribute to this and become a valuable member of a team taking on exciting new projects together. </p>
